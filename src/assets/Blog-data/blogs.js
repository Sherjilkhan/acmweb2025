      "Exploring the rise of startups in India, their innovative solutions, and how they are reshaping industries with technology.",
    content: [
      "I remember the first time I heard the term “unicorn” used in a business context. I was in college, and a friend excitedly mentioned some new startup hitting unicorn status. My mind immediately went to a prancing, mythical horse with a horn, galloping through a field of dollar signs. It sounded so fantastical, so out of a fairy tale, that it felt completely detached from the world of business and spreadsheets. Then I finally got it the metaphor was perfect for a company that defies the odds, growing into a billion-dollar giant.",
      " It got me thinking, what exactly is a startup? It’s not just a company. It’s a group of people, often small, with a huge, audacious idea, a hunch that they can solve a problem or build something better. Think about it. That ride-sharing app we use every day wasn’t always a global powerhouse. Back then, it all started with a couple of people who had a wild idea to completely change how we hail a cab. That’s the magic. They started with a vision, and with a mix of grit, innovation, and a little bit of luck, they turned it into something that has literally changed how we get around.",
      " The startup scene, especially here in India, is buzzing with creativity beyond just building the next social media app. With over 1.59 lakh recognized startups as of early 2025, India is truly becoming a global powerhouse in the tech world. The main idea behind these companies is to use technology to the fullest to help make our daily lives easier and solve real-world problems. It's a whole new world of innovation. It’s about finding solutions to everyday frustrations. How many of us now learn new skills from an ed-tech app, or consult with a doctor through a telemedicine platform without even leaving our homes? The way we date, how we order groceries, and even how we manage our finances all of these are being shaped by nimble, innovative startups.",
      " A great example of this is a company called Qure.ai. While the Covid-19 pandemic made online education platforms a huge deal, the current focus is all on AI. Qure.ai is using artificial intelligence to help doctors read X-rays and CT scans super quickly and accurately. This isn't just about speed, it's about making sure people in smaller towns and rural areas have access to the best medical insights, which is a massive help! It's a quiet revolution happening right in front of us.",

    content: [
      "From Bits to Qubits: The Big Difference",
      "Every device we use today runs on bits(0s or 1s). They process tasks one step at a time. However, quantum computers use qubits which work differently. Thanks to superposition, qubits can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, like a coin spinning in the air, both heads and tails until it lands. Also due to entanglement, qubits become linked like twins changing one instantly affects the other and suddenly there’s a system that can work through countless possibilities at once. This is exactly why quantum computers can solve problems that current ones will take ages to figure out. In April, QpiAI, a bengaluru-based startup built Indus, a 25-qubit quantum computer which is now being used in areas like healthcare (speeding up drug delivery), finance (optimizing complex portfolios and risk analysis) and defence (research into secure communications and cryptography).",
      "But There’s a Catch ",
      "Qubits are very sensitive and lose their quantum properties easily in warm or noisy environments due to decoherence; they require temperatures near absolute zero (colder than deep space). Currently, even the most advanced quantum computers only run on about 50-1000 unstable qubits that are prone to errors, making real-world use burdensome. And this isn’t just technically hard, it’s expensive, costing millions, and right now only a small circle of tech giants like Googles, IBm, and research-heavy universities such as MIT, Oxford, and top IITs can afford to build and maintain on limiting access to elite labs and organizations. ",
      "Opportunities and Risks",
      "The possibilities are fascinating. India stepped into this race with a ₹6003-crore National Quantum Mission launched in 2023, with ISRO and leading institutes like IITs and IISc building advanced quantum labs, positioning the country as a serious global contender in this emerging tech frontier.But there’s a darker side, Quantum computers’ algorithms like Shor’s can easily break encryption methods that protect our internet security (bank accounts, emails, and government secrets). This undeniable threat has initiated a global race to urgently develop Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) before large-scale quantum machines become a reality.",
      "Why Should We Care? ",
      "Quantum isn’t just for scientists. It will reshape industries, economies, and careers in ways that impact everyone: ",
      "1. Engineering & Research - Design stable qubits and scalable processors for practical use. ",
      "2. AI - Use it to train AI models faster and create quantum machine learning. ",
      "3. Data Science - Apply it to analyse huge datasets easily and find hidden patterns.",
      " 4. Cybersecurity - Design encryption for quantum computing to protect banking, government systems, and personal data. ",
      "5. Business & Strategy - New startups and integration of quantum solutions in various existing fields. ",
      "6. Law & Policy - Need for new rules for use of this technology to protect privacy, laws on managing business and cooperation with other countries.",
      "The Bottom Line ",
      "We can’t expect a quantum computer to replace our laptop for the next 5-15 years, it will be more like a supercalculator that helps with complicated problems we can't solve right now. The quantum revolution isn't just a concept for the future, in fact it's happening right now and only those who pay attention and start engaging will shape the tomorrow.",

      "The internet has transformed from a tool into an inseparable part of our daily lives, shaping how we connect, work, and think.",
    content: [
      "Have you ever stopped to think about how much the internet has become a part of your life? It's not just a tool we use anymore, it’s a fundamental part of our existence. Back in the day, when Tim Berners-Lee first created the World Wide Web, it was a revolution. People were amazed by the possibilities, but a small group of people, the so-called modern-day Luddites, were scared. They were ridiculed for being paranoid, for fearing that the internet would replace our social lives and alienate us from one another. Fast forward to today, and you have to wonder, were they really that crazy, or were they simply ahead of their time?",
      "The internet, a system originally meant to share files and communicate, has evolved into an essential need. It’s no longer an “inter-net” , a network connecting devices but an “outer-net,” a reality that exists outside of us and shapes our lives in profound ways.",
      " Think about it. We live through it. It's how we navigate new cities, how we order food when we're too tired to cook, and how we find the perfect playlist for our mood. Our friendships are built on it, our education is delivered through it, and a huge part of our social world exists inside of it. The lines between online and offline are so blurred now, I sometimes wonder if there's a difference at all.",
      " But let's be real, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The same apps that connect us can also trap us in these weird echo chambers where we only hear what we want to hear. The instant access to a world of information also means we're constantly sifting through a mountain of misinformation. And how many of us have felt that little jolt of anxiety when a post doesn't get enough likes? It's a complicated reality.",
      " We’ve integrated the internet into our lives so deeply that it's almost impossible to imagine a world without it. We're on a path where the internet will only become more intrusive, and we have to decide if we're okay with that. It's an uncomfortable topic, and maybe that's why we don't talk about it enough.",
      " So, I’ll leave you with this: the internet has made our lives infinitely better and, in some ways, worse. It’s up to each of us to decide how we navigate this new reality. Are we just passive users, or are we active participants in shaping the future of this “Outernet”?",

      "A glimpse into how quantum computing could break today’s encryption and why preparing with post-quantum security is crucial for the future.",
    content: [
      " Understanding Quantum Computing",
      "Quantum computing is an emergent field of computer science and engineering that harnesses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers. It uses qubits instead of classical bits. Qubits can exist in superposition (representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously) and exhibit entanglement, enabling quantum computers to process many possibilities in parallel.By taking advantage of quantum physics, large-scale quantum computers would be able to tackle certain complex problems many times faster than modern classical machines. With a quantum computer, some problems that might take a classical computer thousands of years to solve might be solved in a matter of minutes or hours.",
      "How Quantum Computing Threatens Today’s Encryption",
      "Encryption is the backbone of modern digital security. Encryption methods such as RSA, ECC and Diffie-Hellman are used to secure data. It protects everything from personal details, bank transactions, health records, messages and even the secrets and passcodes of the national defence system and the government. To protect these data networks we use encryption, a technique that uses complex mathematical problems to jumble data so that even the world’s most skilled computers can’t decode it. It would take them a long time (even centuries) to solve them. That’s why RSA, for example, is widely used for securing online communications, digital signatures, and even blockchain technologies. But with the introduction of quantum computing, this long-standing defence is now at risk. Quantum computers operate on completely different principles. They use qubits instead of bits which give them unique properties such as superposition and entanglement allowing them to work together in ways that vastly increase computing for specific tasks. Quantum computers can process information and solve complex mathematical formulas within minutes that takes even the supercomputers trillions of years to solve. This implies that the world’s secrets may be revealed if quantum computers are strong enough to break the mathematical padlocks protecting encrypted data. In other words, the encryption ways we use now might soon be out of date, leaving our data open to hackers with quantum computers. Quantum algorithms like Shor’s developed by Peter Shor can break RSA which is a widely used public-key cryptosystem, it uses a pair of keys, one public and one private, for encryption and decryption in polynomial time. Experts are advising people to prepare for what some call the Year to Quantum (Y2Q) milestone. In that year, quantum computers can break through encryption to protect electronic communications. ",
      'The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"  Strategy',
      "Even though quantum computers may not have reached that stage, attackers may already be collecting encrypted data today with plans of decrypting it in the future. This approach, harvest now and decrypt later poses a serious threat in the long term for sensitive communications, government secrets, and corporate data. That means the threat isn't just about future data. It's about everything we’re encrypting right now.",
      "QUANTUM DOOMSDAY: HYPE OR REALITY?",
      "Quantum doomsday or Q-day refers to the scenario when there will exist a quantum computer powerful enough to break all modern public key encryption. You might be wondering how that can be a threat or how that is a doomsday scenario. Breaking all encryption means that none of our data will be safe. There exists an algorithm known as the Shor’s Algorithm which can break all encryptions such as RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) which keep our data safe. Anyone with a powerful enough quantum computer would be able to access all your data. Sensitive information could be decrypted, exposing historical and real-time data, and undermining digital privacy. Breaking encryption would not only affect individual privacy but could also disrupt national security and the economy, as digital communications and critical infrastructure would be at risk. If only one country (e.g., a superpower) has quantum supremacy. They could spy on all global communications. Break into foreign systems undetected and gain major intelligence and economic power. The U.S. National Security Agency has said that “the impact of adversarial use of a quantum computer could be devastating to [National Security Systems] and our nation.",
      "Speaking realistically, a Q-day scenario is very likely to happen. Breaking RSA- 2048 requires a fault tolerant quantum computer with approximately 20 million physical qubits due to error correction overload and around 6000 (error corrected) logical qubits and a billion of quantum operations per second. Today’s quantum computers are nowhere near enough to execute Shor's algorithm in a practical setting but in the upcoming decades they will be able to break today’s encryption.",
      "Google’s Willow processor (105 qubits) has achieved an important milestone called below-threshold error correction. This means their system can actually get more accurate as more qubits are added, this a major step toward running big algorithms like Shor’s. Google plans to build a 1 million-qubit machine by around 2035, which is close to what’s needed to break modern encryption like RSA.",
      "IBM’s Quantum System Two uses a flexible, modular architecture. They’ve already built large chips like Heron (156 qubits) and Condor (1,121 qubits) and are connecting them together to scale them up. IBM has a detailed plan to reach fault-tolerant logical qubits by 2029, which are essential to running algorithms like Shor’s. IBM consistently hits major technical goals  adding more qubits, improving quality, and reducing errors each year.",
      "Experts estimate that the Q-day will take place around 2035-2040. It's not the end of the world but it can disrupt our digital lives if we are not prepared for it. Though, we might  be able to prevent it if we start taking measures now.",
      "PREPARING FOR THE POST QUANTUM ERA",
      "The Q-day might arrive someday, but it does not have to be the end of the world. To prevent this from happening researchers are working on post-quantum cryptography encryption. These algorithms are designed to withstand quantum attacks ensuring long-term safety of digital data and communications. You might be wondering how it is different from the current cryptography we use. The current cryptographies like RSA and ECC are based on mathematical problems such as integer factorization and discrete logarithms, while the PQC encryption are built by using different mathematical foundations such as lattice-based problems, hash functions, and multivariate polynomial equations that are difficult for quantum computers to solve. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is taking efforts to standardize these quantum-resistant methods, which will become critical for secure communications and data protection in the future.",
      "CONCLUSION",
      "Quantum computing is a fast growing field. The threat of Q-day is real and approaching but there's no reason to panic. We can still prevent it if we start preparing now. With the development of post-quantum cryptography and early global efforts to secure our digital future, we still have time to act.The choices we make today will determine whether Q-Day is a disaster or just another technological milestone we will overcome.",

      "A journey through the rise of NFTs, from digital collectibles to their future in Web3 and the metaverse.",
    content: [
      "Let's talk about something that's been buzzing in the digital world: NFTs. You've probably heard the term, maybe seen headlines about digital art selling for millions, and wondered, \"What's the big deal?\" Well, buckle up, because we're going on a journey through the evolution of non-fungible tokens.",
      "The Genesis",
      " What Even IS an NFT?Before we dive into the history, let's get the basics straight. NFT stands for non-fungible token. The \"non-fungible\" part is key. Think of a dollar bill; it's fungible, meaning you can trade one dollar for another, and its value remains the same. But your favorite baseball card or a limited-edition sneaker? That's non-fungible. Its value is unique and can't be easily swapped for another.An NFT is basically a digital certificate of ownership for a unique asset. This asset can be anything, a piece of art, a song, a video clip, or even a tweet. This certificate is stored on a blockchain, a public digital ledger that's secure and transparent.The very first seeds of this idea were planted way back in 2013 on the Bitcoin network. They were clunky and a little weird, but they proved you could create a sense of digital scarcity.",
      "The Rise of Digital Collectibles",
      "The real turning point came with Ethereum. Suddenly, developers could create more complex digital tokens. The first major breakthrough was CryptoPunks in 2017. These were 10,000 unique pixel-art characters that were actually given away for free. They exploded in popularity and people realized, \"Whoa, I can own a provably rare digital collectible!\" Right on their heels came CryptoKitties, a game where you could breed and collect unique digital cats. These cats were so popular they famously clogged the Ethereum network, which, while a bit of a headache at the time, showed the entire world the massive demand for digital collectibles.For a long time, NFTs were just a niche thing for crypto enthusiasts. Then, in 2021, the world got a wake-up call. The sale of Beeple's digital artwork \"Everydays: The First 5000 Days\" for a staggering $69 million at Christie's auction house made headlines everywhere. It wasn't just about art anymore; it was about the validation of digital ownership and creativity in a way we'd never seen before.",
      "From JPEGs to a New Reality",
      'Since then, NFTs have exploded. Celebrities, musicians, and major brands have all jumped in. They\'re being used for everything from concert tickets to digital fashion to unique in-game items. The conversation has shifted from "what are they?" to "what can we build with them?"Early on, if you wanted to get into NFTs, you were probably using Ethereum, which was great but also came with something called "gas fees." It was like paying a crazy high cover charge just to get into the party. That\'s where other blockchains like Solana stepped in. They offered a way faster and cheaper experience, which helped bring in a whole new crowd of people. Now, as we\'re heading deeper into Web3 and the metaverse, NFTs are evolving way past just art. Picture this: what if you could buy a limited-edition sword in one game and actually use it in another? Or what if your cool digital jacket was an NFT you could "wear" to a virtual concert with your friends? This is where it gets really interesting. NFTs are becoming a digital passport, letting us carry our identity and assets with us wherever we go online.The hype around NFTs might have quieted down a bit, but the technology is just getting started. I think the real value of NFTs isn\'t the crazy prices we saw for some JPEGs, but their potential to completely change how we think about what it means to own something. They\'re creating a new kind of economy, blending creativity, community, and tech in ways we\'re just beginning to wrap our heads around.',

AI isnt just a tool for developers anymore.Its in our phones, on our “for you pages” that shape our feed, shopping suggestions, and even the voice assistance we use. It is both exciting and unsettling.Exciting because it pushes our creative skills and unsettling because it blurs the line of what we create and what the machine creates.Somewhere between clearing our doubts and generating art, GenAI has crossed the space that made us truly real. That is imagination. ",
      "What makes its so odd is how normal the use of ai has become so rapidly. It creates, imagines and entertains. If treated right it is one of the greatest powers human have. It can be a great strength.Unlike traditional AI, which analyzes, generative AI creates. It can write essays, compose music, and even have a live conversion like a human. ",
      "Still, the fact that we even pause and compare something machine made to our own creativity says a lot. Maybe generative AI is not really about replacing writers, artists or musicians. Maybe it is more like a mirror asking us what actually makes human expression human. A poem by AI might sound pretty, but it does not carry sleepless nights, heartbreak or the little quirks of lived experience. And maybe that is the point, AI makes us value those raw, messy, imperfect pieces of ourselves even more. ",
      "At the same time, we cannot ignore the concerns. If AI is trained on millions of artworks, who owns what it creates. If it can generate believable news, how do we know what to trust. And if so much of our media is generated by machines, do we risk losing the rough edges and flaws that make human work unique. These questions do not have easy answers, but they will shape how we decide to live with this technology. ",

A glimpse of this can be found in the tales of businesses like Google and Airbnb, but the real world is a wild ride filled with obstacles, creativity, and unwavering perseverance. What exactly is the startup world, then? At its heart, a startup isn’t just a new business; it’s a company in its earliest stages, driven by one or more entrepreneurs with a burning purpose: to develop a scalable business model.A startup is different from a typical small business because its core is all about innovation.They're trying to fix an old problem in a new, game-changing way, using tech to build something that can grow quickly and shake up an entire industry. This ambition is super risky, and most are broke at first, so they really depend on outside money from people like angel investors and venture capitalists. This whole high-risk, high-reward scene is the definition of the startup world.",
      " The Silent Co-Founder: How Tech Has Changed the Game",
      "While the journey is a huge risk, there’s a cool part: we're not starting from scratch. We have a massive, shared library of knowledge right at our fingertips. Every failure and wild success from the past decade is documented online as a free blueprint of what works and, maybe more importantly, what doesn't. We can learn how to find the right customers from the founders of Airbnb or about building a great product from the early days of Instagram. Imagine it's like we've got a secret weapon, a collective wisdom that simply didn't exist for the startups that came before us. It's like having a cheat code. Let's move on from the subject of cheat codes to the true hero of contemporary startups: technology. It is no longer just a tool; it is now the silent co-founder. Think about how members of a small group can work together even if they are not in the same room. Ten years ago, that meant misplaced files and awkward email exchanges. These days, a shared Google Doc allows a global team to collaborate in real time on improving a new idea. You don't need a big server room to scale your data and apps when you use cloud storage.

      "Cinema - the dream with the eyes wide opened. The basic idea of Cinema was to capture and portray life on the silver screen and to make it even more beautiful with artistic touch so that the people dare to dream, getting rid of the day to day boredom. Cinema has always been an art of light, shadow, and imagination created by the humans. Today, a new collaborator has stepped into the frame — Generative AI — creating images, voices, and edits into existence at the speed of light. What once took months or even more in pre-production or post can now be created with a line of text, yet behind the magic lies a quiet storm of questions about authorship, originality, and truth.",
      "Previs, or Previsualization, was previously made through demo shoots, hand-drawn sketches, paintings, and other costly, difficult processes just to either see how the film will look or to pitch it to the producers. But now - previsualization is now painted by algorithms. Runway’s Gen-3 and OpenAI’s Sora create visuals just from text prompts, letting the makers test moods and camera angles before a single actor takes the stage. They do not yet replace humans, but they open dream-doors into worlds waiting to be built. AI has, in effect, become a sketchbook for the moving image. Quite nice and quick - but it still somehow questions the authentication and originality of the real creators. ",
      "In the editing suite, AI tools act as invisible masterminds. Adobe’s Generative Fill composites frames, generates objects, lengthens stills, and polishes sound — offering editors more freedom to sculpt rhythm and feeling. What once required costly pickup shoots or sound engineers can now be done in seconds. The risk is subtle: when the seam between real and fabricated vanishes, one question still bothers the audience -  does the film still breathe with its maker’s pulse? Yes ? Or no ? God knows ! But the generative AI blessings have really made the lengthy and tiring processes much smoother and easier. For independent creators, the AI solves their budget problem. There are platforms like LTX Studio that promise the creator the power to storyboard, cast, and stage their respective scenes. What once demanded a team of dozens can now be attempted by a single filmmaker with a laptop.",
      "Hollywood’s unions are already sketching the boundaries of this new age creative process. In 2023, the WGA secured a contract requiring studios to disclose AI-generated material and protect writers’ credits.Which was, and still is, an indeed requirememnt to protect creative credits. SAG-AFTRA, has negotiated consent and compensation rules for digital replicas of performers, to prevent studios from limitless reusing an actor’s scan without any approval. These agreements are although imperfect, but they indicate an essential truth: the future of Cinema cannot be written by technology alone — it must also be authored by labor, law, and ethics. Cinema is made for, made by none other humans. It consists of emotions and imperfections - that technology can not generate. The inherent beauty of imperfections is what makes a film more real, original and close to heart. Moreover, AI is not the director, but a restless assistant. The question is simple, and profound: will cinema guide the machine, or will the machine begin to guide cinema ?",
      "Cinema has always evolved with its own tools—from sound to colour, from celluloid to digital cameras, from real location to CGI and chroma key. AI is simply the latest arrival, a collaborator whose role is still being written. The challenge ahead is to ensure that in every frame and every voice, the soul of storytelling—the human pulse—remains unmistakably alive. Every gift arrives with responsibility. If used carelessly, AI risks flattening cinema into a hall of mirrors where originality is uncertain and human artistry is diminished. If used wisely, it can serve as a bridge to tell stories —helping the makers to imagine the impossible, reach wider audiences, and bend time and cost in their favor.",

Empowering women in tech isn’t about meeting a diversity quota; it’s about unlocking a powerful, untapped force that can drive the industry forward.",
      "Why a Diverse Workforce is a Better Workforce",
      "Diversity is beneficial to teams, especially Diverse teams are more innovative, successful, and productive, according to research. Women's unique perspectives and life experiences stimulate innovative approaches to problem-solving and innovative solutions. Our technology would be extremely limited and miss out on a lot if it were all created by one group. Women provide invaluable insights that range from knowing what different users need to approaching a problem with an entirely different perspective when there are more women on the team. We've definitely made some strides, though. The number of women in tech is slowly but surely climbing. While there's still work to do, women are making significant strides in tech. Approximately 35% of tech jobs in the United States are held by women. The STEM percentage is about 28% worldwide. 91% of businesses are now focused on promoting women in tech, a significant increase from prior years, according to a 2024 Deloitte report. Yet, only 11% of tech executives are women, highlighting the journey ahead.",
      "Facing Down the Challenges",
      "So what's holding us back? It's a mix of things. Stereotypes and unconscious bias can push girls away from coding and robotics early on. At work, a lack of female mentors, a toxic culture, and unequal pay can make women feel like they have no choice but to leave. We must address these problems if we are to genuinely empower women. Creating an inclusive workplace is essential. The goal is to establish a setting where everyone is treated with dignity. This entails establishing unambiguous policies prohibiting discrimination, providing flexible work arrangements, and honoring the accomplishments of female tech executives. When girls and women see successful role models like Lisa Su and Reshma Saujani, it completely shatters the myth that tech is just a \"boys' club.\" Seeing is believing, and those visible successes inspire the next generation to go for their dreams without a second thought. This isn't just up to companies, though; it’s on all of us. To encourage more women in tech, we need to start early.",
      "The Women Who Are Shaping Our World",
      "Women aren't just in tech; they're the ones building it and driving change. Their impact can be seen everywhere, from initial inventions to the current state of AI leadership. Consider Hedy Lamarr. This well-known actress was a brilliant inventor who helped develop the technology that made Wi-Fi and Bluetooth possible. Modern wireless communication was truly made possible by her efforts. Women have reached the top these days. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, completely transformed the business and turned it into a powerful force in AI and computing. And then there's Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code. Her organization has reached over 450,000 girls around the world.",
      "The future of technology relies on us using every bit of human talent we have. By making a real effort to empower women, we're not just building a fairer industry; we're making a more creative, more innovative, and ultimately, more successful one for everyone. As a community, we must challenge the biases holding women back.",

      "A look at how Indian engineering students contributed to Chandrayaan-3 through simulations, hardware design, and rover navigation—showing that classroom skills can directly power national space missions.",
    content: [
      "In India’s expanding space sector, the distinction between classroom projects and actual space  missions is getting thinner by the day. For many engineering students, the skills they develop in  areas like programming, machine learning, and embedded systems in college are now directly  influencing India’s space adventures. ",
      "Let us discuss Chandrayaan-3, ISRO's third lunar exploration mission, launched on July 14,  2023, and successfully landed on August 23, 2023. The mission’s aim is to enhance soft landing capabilities, study the Moon’s south pole, and perform experiments on soil, temperature,  and seismic activity. Its success led India to be the first nation to reach the South Pole region,  showcasing our innovation and proving that we can set milestones in space exploration. ",
      "However, the interesting part is the contributions made by students (under guidance). They  helped in the following ways: ",
      "1. Simulating and Modeling Soft-Landing Dynamics: ",
      "At Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, students and faculty developed mathematical models  and simulations in MATLAB for the soft-launching phase of the lunar lander. The  students created a digital environment where the Vikram lander’s descent could be  tested as if it were happening on the real lunar surface, allowing the spacecraft to land  hundreds of times on a computer, testing worst-case scenarios and finding the safest  path without risking hardware or spending a huge amount on physical mocks.",
      " 2. Designing Stepper Motors for LVM-3:",
      " At Sona College of Technology, engineering students and researchers collaborated to  design a permanent magnet stepper motor for its rocket’s actuator system. This motor  acts like a chef controlling the flame while cooking, ensuring the right amount of fuel and  oxidizer flow to the engines at exactly the right time. This design met ISRO’s strict and  demanding spaceflight standards. This was later manufactured by an industry partner for  actual mission use, hence proving that hardware created in a college lab can power a  rocket carrying India’s space dreams. ",
      "3. 3D Vision & Rover Navigation: ",
      "At IIT Kanpur, students helped develop stereoscopic vision. Two cameras were used to  build 3D images of the Moon’s surface, along with motion-planning software for the  Pragyan rover. These tools allowed the rover to map its surroundings, detect any  obstacles, and safely navigate across the moon. ",
      "Through internships, hackathons, and collaborative research programs, ISRO and private space  startups are enabling students to contribute meaningfully to active, real-life missions. For India’s  next generation of computer engineers like us, space technology is no longer a distant  aspiration; it is a dream in action where our code, algorithms, and innovations can directly  influence missions of national and global significance.",
      "One may wonder why students, instead of skilled professionals. There are a few key reasons: ",
      "1. Fresh problem-solving approaches - Since students aren’t bound by the norms of “this is  how we have always done it”, they propose creative and unconventional solutions.1",
      "2. Specialized skills - Most final year engineering students have strong hands-on  experience and knowledge in tools like MATLAB, Python, and simulation software,  making them well-suited for rapid prototyping. ",
      "3. Research partnerships - ISRO collaborates with universities to spread work, save costs,  and nurture talent for future missions. ",
      "4. High motivation - This is a career-defining opportunity for students, so they tend to work  harder and put in extra effort. ",
      "5. Mentored learning - These projects are supervised by experienced faculty and ISRO  scientists, which ensures the work will meet high-quality standards. ",
      "In Chandrayaan-3’s case, the students clearly provided fresh mathematical models and quick turnaround simulations, which complemented ISRO’s existing expertise and allowed senior  engineers to focus on critical systems for the mission. This helped students practice their  learning and gain hands-on experience in real-world space challenges. They aren’t here to  replace the experts, but rather to provide a helping hand to strengthen the mission in certain  aspects. This is a great initiative being taken not just by ISRO, but also by other private space  startups.",

      "A look into the importance of cybersecurity, its threats, and how individuals and organizations can stay protected.",
    content: [
      "Imagine waking up in the morning to find your social media or bank account hacked! Sounds like a nightmare, right? Yet some people and organizations across the world are actually victims of this. Welcome to the world of cybersecurity, a battleground that exists in the invisible spaces of the internet but has very real consequences in our lives.",
      " Cybersecurity may sound like a technical buzzword, but at its heart, it’s truly about trust. It’s about knowing that your private information stays private, that your data is accurate, and that the services you depend on like your bank or a hospital's systems are available when you need them. These three elements-confidentiality, integrity, and availability form the backbone of digital safety. Without them, the online world we depend on could quickly fall into chaos.",
      "The digital world is a wild place. We've all heard of viruses and malware, but that's just the beginning. Phishing scams are everywhere, with fake emails that look so incredibly real they can fool anyone. Ransomware can lock down an entire company's data in the blink of an eye, holding it hostage until they pay up. And thanks to artificial intelligence, new-age threats like deepfakes are blurring the line between what’s real and what’s fake. Even everyday gadgets smart speakers, fitness trackers, or Wi-Fi-connected lights can be entry points for hackers if they are not secured properly.",
      "So, what can we do? The good news is, you don't need to be a tech genius to protect yourself. It's all about a few simple habits. Using a strong, unique password for everything, turning on two-factor authentication, and keeping your apps and devices updated. That alone creates huge roadblocks for anyone trying to attack you. Think of it like locking your front door and check your windows before you leave. On a much larger scale, companies are beefing up their defenses with tools like firewalls and data encryption. They’re even starting to use technologies like AI and machine learning to automatically spot anything unusual and shut down threats before they can cause any real damage. Governments are stepping up, too, creating stronger laws and working together because an attack on a country's power grid or hospital system isn't just a digital issue it can literally be a matter of life and death.",
      "The future of our digital world",
      "The future of cybersecurity is both exciting and challenging. We can fight more intelligently thanks to advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, but attackers can launch sophisticated attacks using the same tools. Although revolutionary, quantum computing has the potential to crack the encryption that currently guards our online environment. Because of this never-ending competition, cybersecurity will never be a “finished” job, it will always be about staying one step ahead.",
      "Ultimately, cybersecurity is our problem, not just someone else's. You're making the internet a little safer every time you pick a strong password, check a dubious link twice, or remind a friend to update their phone. It's more than about computers and code. It's about people, trust, and our shared future. The internet has given us so many incredible opportunities, but to fully enjoy them, we have to protect it. And that protection starts with you.",

      "An exploration of asteroid mining the futuristic pursuit of water, metals, and trillions in resources from space that could reshape economies and transform humanity’s future beyond Earth.",
    content: [
      "You would probably assume it was the opening line of a science fiction film if someone told you that there is a rock worth trillions of dollars floating in space. However, it isn't. There are currently old pieces of ice and metal strewn across planets that have the potential to completely alter the global economy. And like fortune seekers once flocked to Earth's gold fields, people may one day rush to claim them. The ultimate treasure hunt in the weightless silence of space is asteroid mining. ",
      "The remnants of the solar system, preserved for billions of years, are asteroids. They vary widely in size; some are larger than mountains, while others are hardly larger than cars. Unthinkable wealth is concealed within them, including water, the most valuable material in space, rare metals that power our electronics and green technologies, gold, platinum, and nickel. Since water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel, it is far more valuable than gold out here. For spacecraft travelling to Mars, a single asteroid with a lot of water could act as a floating petrol station. Then there is the myth of 16 Psyche, a huge metallic asteroid that may hold more metal than all of humanity's mining activities put together. Its theoretical worth? Trillions upon trillions of dollars. ",
      "The catch is that swinging a pickaxe in zero gravity isn't exactly possible. Mining in space requires the use of equipment that can withstand extremely high temperatures, function without an atmosphere, and attach itself to a rock that is hardly supporting them at all. Spacecraft towing small asteroids into lunar orbit where they can be processed more easily, lasers vaporising rock and collecting the valuable vapour, or robots that resemble spiders drilling into the asteroid's surface are some of the suggested techniques that seem like they belong in a futuristic video game. The OSIRIS-REx mission, which flew to the asteroid Bennu in 2023, collected a small amount of its surface material, and returned it to Earth, was NASA's first foray into this world. That was just a taste of what future mining missions could look like. ",
      "This is not going to be simple, of course. Even with the advent of reusable rockets, the cost of launching equipment into space remains high. The field of mining technology is still relatively young. Then there is the question of who truly owns an asteroid, to which no one has a satisfactory answer as of yet. Although the current international space laws prohibit the ownership of celestial bodies, some nations have already enacted legislation allowing corporations to retain the materials they extract. This implies that the first actual space miners may also be the ones to start significant court cases pertaining to property rights in space. ",
      "The rewards could be huge despite all the challenges. Instead of transporting every last drop of fuel from Earth, picture spaceships refuelling in orbit. Consider using the metals from asteroids to construct space stations and lunar habitats rather than sending bulky construction materials through Earth's atmosphere. Imagine if we could obtain resources from space instead of destructively mining our planet. Space will cease to be a distant place and turn into a place where we can actually live the moment that humans are able to obtain materials from sources outside of Earth. ",
      "Asteroid mining is one of those historical thresholds that once you cross, there's no going back: It could open the door to a whole new world for mankind - much like the first ship to sail across the oceans or the first aeroplane to fly through the skies but this time the frontier will be soundless, airless and infinite - but the wealth is simply floating in space waiting for someone brave enough to take it.",
